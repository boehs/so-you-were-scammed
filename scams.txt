Don't accept random friend requests from low-level Steam accounts unless you played a game with them and would like to add them or are okay getting spammed by bots.

There is no such thing as "item verification", and no Steam employee will ever ask you to send them your items for any reason. If you get a trade offer for in-game items be careful to look for and read a pop-up dialog if any is shown -- games have been making fake items with names and graphics from Team Fortress 2 and other games which are being used to scam-trade worthless items for those of value, and a pop-up now shows if you're trading for things from a game you've never played.

valve emploeeys will never contact you using any live chat platform such as steam chat or discord.
